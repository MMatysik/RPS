Extra Credit : What if we threw in Hammer as a choice?  How would you represent more than 3 choices?

If we add only one extra option, it will lead to an issue, when one player has more chances to win, 
because in this case we cannot keep the probability of wins, losses and draws for each player in a balance, 
in other words one choice will have more chances to win while the others - less.
It means that for every choice you have to have an even number of extra moves, keeping the total number of choices odd.
So we cannot add only one extra choice, it should be two, four, six etc.
